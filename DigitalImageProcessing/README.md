# Description:

Slides and materials from the course "Digital Image Processing" that I taught in Universidad de San Buenaventura and Universidad Aut√≥noma de Occidente in Cali (Colombia) from 2012 to 2016. The textbook for the course was: R. Gonzalez, R. Woods. Digital Image Processing. 3rd edition. Prentice Hall. 2008. The slides are written in Spanish and they are based on the [support material]( http://www.imageprocessingplace.com/) for the textbook.
