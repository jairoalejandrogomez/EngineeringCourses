# Description:

These are the laboratory guides that I developed in Matlab/Octave for a course in Signals and Systems that I taught at Universidad Autónoma de Occidente (UAO) for an Engineering group in Cali (Colombia) during the first semester of 2016. The laboratories are written in Spanish. The code works well under Windows. 

Some of the topics covered include: visualizing signals, transformations in time and amplitude, complex exponentials, signals defined by segments, odd and even signals, convolution, DFT, FFT, Fourier Series, graphs of poles and zeros, and Filtering. 

The reference book for the course was: A. V Oppenheim. Señales y sistemas, segunda edición, México, Prentice-Hall, 1998.
